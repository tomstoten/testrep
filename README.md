# testrep

This is a README file for the testrep repository created for APPM4600 at CU Boulder. It contains a directory with a basic python library for plotting figures using matplotlib and numpy. It also contains the complete code for the first lab for APPM4600, which plots two trigonometric curves and then changes the scale of the axes to logarithmic. 

I have been using git for over 5 years for school, and have experience using git professionally. This is more text to make sure the character count hit five hundred.
